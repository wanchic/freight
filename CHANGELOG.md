# freight

**freight** will be a an automated Ruby on Rails Generator, and so, so much more.

## [0.0.2] - 2020-02-03
Well, I couldn't believe it! After I pushed up changes to the **fr8** gem just last night, I discovered I had access & ownership to the **freight** gem! WOW!

I have to thank Tim Cull for making this possible. Please read the [[0.0.0 alpha] - 2012-12-12](#0.0.0-alpha) entry for his story.
 
So now I'm restarting the **freight** gem, transferring the code I have from **fr8** & my previous local **freight** gem to here, and temporarily suspending **fr8**. I have some ideas I might use later on for **fr8** in conjunction with **freight**... we'll see.

Palindrome Day, the 1st global palindrome day in 909 years...which is also a palindrome!

Anyway, a month ago I was telling the story to my wife about obtaining the **fr8** gem name, and to my shock I saw downloads. DOWNLOADS!? What the heck? And I didn't even add any code. 

As of right now, there are 320 downloads!? It's been too long to have NOTHING added, especially since I have so much code written already. The Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year season kept me too busy. So now I'm returning to add... some things!

My hope is to continue to add a little bit each day/week until I get to where I expected to be before the end of 2019.

Thank you to the people who are curious. Stay curious! I guarantee you will not be disappointed to find out what's coming.

## [0.0.0] - 2019-11-11
This project initially started on 2019-09-24 under the gem name of **freight**. I continued to write code adding about 19 additional updates until 2019-10-18. 

At this point I got frustrated not being able to obtain the **freight** name even though I was given the blessing from the original owner, Tim Cull, by email. Without this, I wasn't able to push the code up publicly. And honestly, I wasn't sure which parts of my code I wanted to push up anyway.

So, I creatively (with the inspiration from God) thought up the **fr8** name. So I immediately wrote a blank gem, pushed up the code and claimed the **fr8** gem on Nov 11, 2019.

## [0.0.0 alpha] - 2012-12-12

The **freight** gem was initially published by Tim Cull *(trcull{at}pollen.io)* back in December 12, 2012. His initial description for the **freight** gem reads:

> A Ruby based ESB-like integration bus, inspired by the Enterprise Integration Patterns book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. Kind of like Apache Camel, except less enterprisey

No further work was done after this point.

I contacted Tim on 2019-21-09 requesting to obtain ownership of the **freight** gem. Over the next few months, he graciously agreed to turn over ownership to myself, and on February 1st I was given full access to the gem.

I'd like to thank Tim for supporting me in this endeavour, and I wish Tim the best of luck in his future endeavours. 

Thank you Tim! God bless and good luck!
