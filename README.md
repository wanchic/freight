# Freight

Welcome to "Freight"!! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/fr8`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'freight'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install freight

## Usage

    $ irb
    2.5.7 :001 > require 'freight'
     => true 
    2.5.7 :002 > Freight.announce
    Ruby on Rails with Freight!!
     => nil 
    2.5.7 :003 > 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
